    Laser powder fusion is a type of additive manufacturing process, also known as 3D printing. In this process, a laser is used to melt and fuse together powdered materials to create a solid object. The process typically takes place on a platform, or bed, which serves as the base on which the object is built. This bed is often made of a material that can withstand high temperatures, such as ceramic or metal, and is typically heated to help ensure that the powdered materials fuse properly.\\
